# EnglishL Language and Compiler
## Welcome to the official repository of the EnglishL markup language!
This is the official repository where we have our code compiler and where we have our source code for it. We will be constantly updating our language.\
As of right now browsers can't unfortunately index out language.\
Much more to come.\
